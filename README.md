# Awesome Portfolios

This is a collection of awesome portfolios. I think portfolios are a great way of demonstrating skills and of showcasing your work, which is why I wanted to share a list of portfolios I've come across that either look stunning because of the work, but mostly because of the presentation.

Obviously that's also a matter of taste, but I figure it would probably be interesting for different people of different industries to have a look at all of them.

For some portfolios I've written a short blog post about them, including screen shots, so you can have a look at those too if you like.
